Replacement Power Supply for the Sony PSX DESR Consoles

# About
This project came about after I ordered a PSX Desr and was unable to use it in Australia due to different power voltages. After guesstimating the DC voltage and testing the system with an old computer power supply, I started working on designing a new power supply that could be run of a PicoPSU. This concept was short lived in favor of just getting a dedicated 12v power brick to supply the console that would work regardless of where in the would you were; as all you needed to do was change the plug provided it was a 100-240v power brick and the output would still be the same. 

The initial concept PCB used a 24pin connection from a computer psu but was ditched and the design was revised to be more optimized and to include more protection for the console by adding a fuse and capacitor/inductor to smooth the current and voltage being passed to the system.
